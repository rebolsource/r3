## 2020 June

### Features:

* [`a7d02d`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a7d02dae51242b39af025c75d3d3c677d19ce6eb) Loading .txt files with unicode encodings

  Text files (.txt) are now loaded just as a string and not as a Rebol code. Unicode decoding is handled correctly if specified in BOM. Files (.txt) are always saved as UTF-8.
  
  fixes: https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/2424

* [`b78129`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/b7812968a56e804da7ee594407972005a49319ad) `mold/part` to limit the length of the result
* [`217fce`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/217fce7606dcc2c56ca6f03c6f8aa0eb9fc1fa75) Optionally execute `user.r3` file in user's home directory on startup and removing temporary help functions which now may be defined in user's file.
* [`962382`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/96238234691cdfd08ab2d133e502db75e4e6f426) Added `ppk` (PuTTY Private Key) codec (so far only RSA keys)
* [`4c07b7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4c07b7a0fee9fd0277cb2018c3878acd1850ae35) Added `ssh-key` (Secure Shell Key) codec (so far only RSA keys)
* [`90ecb3`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/90ecb3dddfc980fd981f409a0c868a422d6c7a3c) Added missing `UI32BYTES` and `UI32LEBYTES` _bincode_ read commands
* [`df2c2a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/df2c2abe48ba335cd961862568a28cbfce36ca2a) Implemented proper `ask/hide` and `input/hide`

  That was not working well on Windows (with enabled virtual terminal processing), now it successfully hides user input.
  
  As a bonus this change contain a way how to turn off read-line console input and enter use the console as a key-stroke (and mouse as well) input. Simple use example is available here:
  https://gist.github.com/Oldes/face8a5790df7121a78ba606a3e150f4

### Changes:

* [`c8799b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/c8799b73fa7d4df9735b1d56e412848882ac3cf4) Using Bjoern Hoehrmann's UTF-8 decoder

  http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/
  It is shorter and faster.
* [`6416be`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6416be56b9bac994405da65cec54cd29e8fd2719) Migrate extensions: *.r => *.reb & *.rx => *.rebx

  This change was proposed years ago by @onetom in https://github.com/rebol/rebol/pull/140 and I agree, that the `.r` extension is lost in this century and so lets start with the new one. I'm personally still preferring `.r3` for run-able scripts which requires Rebol3.
  
* [`1e1dfa`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1e1dfa3282c0f8fd2f184bf81cbcdf358ac182b5) Rename `split/into` to `split/skip`
* [`214790`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2147901da9398b0d150ccefba0f02105a1ff1cb1) Setup `system/options/home` to default user's system home location or to one defined in `REBOL_HOME` environment variable

  For example to define custom location one can use on Windows:
  ```
  set REBOL_HOME=C:\Rebol\
  ```
  or on Linux:
  ```
  export REBOL_HOME=~/Rebol/
  ```
* [`2b2352`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2b23527852526ac9d510ce49e6d3ccd67c7053d9) Allow private RSA exponents optional (may be computed and are not in PPK files)
* [`3d1436`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3d1436ab57ae6f0e9d26a28cc5c0a9315d6f2d36) Using lowercase in codec names (it looks better)
* [`db5b44`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/db5b44a6a9376a061c3d36b95de0edc2936a52cb) Replaced `mezz-crypt` module with `pkix` and `utc-time` codecs

### Fixes:

* [`6f8324`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6f8324fc38e53505fe0950ca673b296dedec7890) Avoid making a new bitset! on each `suffix?` call

* [`5e32c5`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/5e32c54a850b7cb03328f5f54cb27064458a8918) `deline/lines` and `read/lines` misinterprets UTF-8 character as newline
* [`e7e72b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/e7e72b54489eab5910bf3315719525cea0d47f19) Missing file with `mold/part` native specification

* [`1317e1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1317e13a8ad80bade1e37a1c7224e2d3be2aa314) Path expression with path! does not work with all supported key types
* [`652045`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6520457a3bdcf4a121076c40ead3923fc94be313) Using `deline` to normalize CRLF to LF when reading text HTML content
* [`6238d2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6238d23e53a0329a5b36c8673da926e248b35c69) Allow incomplete tag in DER codec (because it looks it can happen)

* [`f09962`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f099629adfab50b31a01f6a200aacc12afad6c95) ENLINE does not convert line endings to native OS format (Posix)
* [`70c51b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/70c51ba9dff10c967b7bde3de781d1b12939d98a) Crash in `enline`


## 2020 May

### Features:

* [`55a8f9`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/55a8f921935386e10028b74fd0bf502571e34fb7) Enable raw `map!` and `binary!` data in HTTP scheme's `write` action

  Using this:
  ```
  write http://localhost:8081/result/ #{0102}
  write http://localhost:8081/result/ #(a: 1)
  
  ```
  is now same like:
  ```
  write http://localhost:8081/result/ [POST #(Content-Type: "application/octet-stream") #{0102}]
  write http://localhost:8081/result/ [POST #(Content-Type: "application/json; charset=utf-8") #(a: 1)]
  
  ```
* [`01284d`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/01284d6b966511902396f7837a27b6ec34425ff6) Ported Nenad's MySQL driver to be compatible with this Rebol3 version as a module/scheme

  It's just a quick rewrite, which replaces original `debug` function in the protocol with system logging and some of required modifications. There is also minnor change in error reporting. It would deserve better rewrite, but I don't have much need for this, so it's left for future or someone else.
  
  It was tested only with this so far:
  ```
  >> mysql: connect-sql mysql://root:rur@localhost/
   [MySQL] Connected: mysql://root@localhost:3306/
  >> send-sql mysql "show databases"
  == [["information_schema"] ["mysql"] ["performance_schema"] ["sys"] ["test"]]
  
  >> send-sql mysql "create database test"
  ** mysql error: [ 1007 ] "Can't create database 'test'; database exists"
  
  >> send-sql mysql "drop database test"
  == []
  
  >> send-sql/flat mysql "show databases"
  == ["information_schema" "mysql" "performance_schema" "sys"]
  
  >> close mysql
   [MySQL] Closed: mysql://root@localhost:3306/
  >>
  ```
* [`46810b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/46810b3fd487cc180b8ad7542a3d4b7afacc94a8) Allow protocols to be modules accessible from user context, if exports some functions
* [`f367ee`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f367ee5260f2af27989c470f77fd812089e76efc) It's again possible to `read dns://` to resolve a hostname

  ```
  >> read dns://
  == "Oldes-Aero"
  ```
  
  It also fixes a bug introduce in https://github.com/rebol/rebol/pull/66, that resolving domain name from ip was not possible at all. Now it's again working properly:
  ```
  >> read dns://rebol.com
  == 162.216.18.225
  >> read dns://162.216.18.225
  == "rebol.com"
  
  ```
* [`61596e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/61596e22c9975d1878f1194c3856493eb1c30246) `HTML-entities` decoder

  For decoding HTML entities into text:
  ```rebol
  >> decode 'html-entities {Test: &spades; & &#162; &lt;a&gt;&#32;and &Delta;&delta; &frac34;}
  == "Test: ♠ & ¢ <a> and Δδ ¾"
  
  ```
* [`640f91`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/640f916d849be6442cdc4db296389d4e7986ac1c) Including R2's version of the `build-tag` function

  (but not enabled by default in boot-files)
* [`09d560`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/09d56000dab875a4f19d534d118b6291fe050716) Added `pad` mezzanine function
* [`3f08fa`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3f08fa6894fbe6805dbcb72259a9e8eb91e69708) Updated HTTPD scheme with directory listing, logging and multipart POST processing
* [`ae88f0`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ae88f041fd2e48d2d6e94d0c4a97e278c803b69e) Enhanced `DEHEX` with `/escape` refinement for changing the escape character

  Can be used as:
  ```rebol
  >> dehex/escape "a#20b" #"#"
  == "a b"
  ```
* [`f4a1fc`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f4a1fc6683b703220eb45744804b97b9d1ce0d9a) New `resize` native function for resizing images (without any external dependency)

  The code was ported from GraphicsMagick (www.graphicsmagick.org).
  
  Basic usage example:
  ```rebol
  original-image: load %some-image.jpg
  resized-image-1: resize original-image 25%
  resized-image-2: resize original-image 100x200 ;- resized to exact size
  resized-image-3: resize original-image 100     ;- resized to width 100 (height is computed)
  resized-image-4: resize original-image 0x200   ;- resized to height 200 (width is computed)
  
  ```
  
  By default, `Lanczos` resize filter is used. It is possible to use one of filters, which are listed in `system/catalog/filters`:
  
  Here is example how to resize the original using width 250 with all filters. Results are saved as PNG files:
  
  ```rebol
  foreach filter system/catalog/filters [
      save join %image- [filter %.png] resize/filter original-image 250 filter
  ]
  ```

### Changes:

* [`8b0e6a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/8b0e6a7ce25ab0a2a6fc190753ec3882ccffa784) Using `system/platform` just as a `word!`

  Before:
  ```
  >> system/platform
  == [Windows win32-x64]
  ```
  Now:
  ```
  >> system/platform
  == Windows
  
  >> system/build/os
  == win32-x64
  
  ```
  
  Reason is, that in most cases only the `platform` name is needed so one had to use for example `switch system/platform/1 [...]`, which was a little bit cryptic. It is now also compatible with Red language.
* [`a55673`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a55673f2a159e6c561525de6901db0b262237c1a) Moved AS_DECIMAL define

  used to receive decimal value, when argument may be decimal or integer

## 2020 April

### Features:

* [`d4a138`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d4a1385e01b97c83df025864cfe0219b43373256) New PROTECTED? function

  Which take all of the same argument types as PROTECT, and return TRUE if that immediate argument is protected from modification.
* [`dd2ec1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/dd2ec13eae7cc888d0d7f11e771270cac3657c18) Added new `dir-tree` function which prints a directory tree

  This function is based on Toomas Vooglaid's `%dir-tree.red` script, which is available here: https://gist.github.com/toomasv/f2bcf320800ca340379457c1c4036338
  
  It was modified for use in Rebol3 and improved to support user's callback for more advanced formating of values.
* [`ba200f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ba200f70feb234dd59c711ef40c08d952f8fbe40) Including GIT info in `system/build`

  Before this commit, `system/build` was returning just a date, when the executable was compiled.
  Now it is an object, with keys `date` and `git`. If the executable is compiled from a valid git repository, `git` contains another object with info about actual `repository`, `branch`, `commit` and it's `message`.
  
  With this info it will be easier to localize possible regressions against older executables.
* [`0b3531`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/0b3531fdadbfd647a7de7321aec4a5b53eaefc8a) Added simple `mobileprovision` codec,

  which can be used to load Apple's mobile provisioning files as a string for examination (without need to use Apple's tools).
  ```rebol
  >> print load %some.mobileprovision
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
          <key>AppIDName</key>
          <string>My App</string>
          <key>ApplicationIdentifierPrefix</key>
          <array>
  …
  ```
* [`2e41df`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2e41df086040bd0bfec92bf75c80ec82330d6499) Added a few more names into OID decoder and using more optimal chars instead of single byte binaries
* [`ad49c4`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ad49c4404bc83b6125d1632a986e1df43299b817) Registered `certSigningRequest` file extension with PKIX decoder
* [`1dca01`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1dca01bb65a04ad0f66ecacdb7346592d737b7fe) Added BBCode decoder for converting BBCode markup language into HTML

  For more info about BBCode you can visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode
* [`628e6b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/628e6b725b79e22a0c08efb2719f90a3e1e01b27) Added support for `find` on `map!`

  This feature was introduced in Red language so it is good to be compatible.
  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> find #("a" 1 "b" "c") "A"
  == "a"
  
  >> find #("a" 1 "b" "c") 1
  == none
  
  >> find/case #("a" 1 "b" "c") "A"
  == none
  ```
* [`a74222`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a74222aa8ce4e243b2725ecc125cb160f3f85895) Added support for `zero?` on bitsets.

  `zero?` return TRUE if no bits are set in a bitset!
  ```rebol
  >> zero? make bitset! #{0000}
  == true
  
  >> zero? make bitset! #{1000}
  == false
  ```
* [`fa8fc6`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/fa8fc685f2ffeb4cac9535c6828f657a7400f24f) New native `complement?`

  Returns TRUE if the bitset is complemented. Like:
  ```rebol
  >> complement? make bitset! [not]
  == true
  
  >> complement? make bitset! []
  == false
  
  >> complement? complement charset "abc"
  == true
  ```
* [`5d5bf7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/5d5bf7ffec2c340fa31f2f88b4473ed3ab1df0cf) Implemented `query` on date values

  So one can query multiple date parts with one call, for example:
  ```rebol
  >> query/mode now [year day month time timezone]
  == [2020 8 4 12:24:54 2:00]
  ```
  If set words are used, the result is like:
  ```rebol
  >> query/mode now [year: month:]
  == [
      year: 2020
      month: 4
  ]
  ```
  Simple `query now` would return object with all possible fields.
* [`ae61eb`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ae61ebb1dc8b8b8ba614cd334c20d0dd699c908c) Implemented basic user-defined OP!

  I'm not much fan of _ops_, but now it's possible to do code like:
  ```rebol
  >> .: make op! [[a b][ join a b ]]
  >> "a"."b".(random 10)
  == "ab1"
  ```
  
  Current limitation is, that there is no runtime check of first argument's type!
* [`1e55b6`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1e55b65039d1dcee431f3465ce9ad0e6e5106a18) UNPROTECT/words object!
* [`309280`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/309280675a52cf5f27613b1bcee9136faec485c5) PROTECT/words supported for an object! value

  PROTECT object! now protects the object and its words, but not their values.
  
  PRODUCT/deep object! protects the object, its words, and their values.
  
  PROTECT/words object! only protects the words of the object!, but not the object itself or the values of the words.
  
  PROTECT/words/deep object! also protects any values assigned to the words, but still not protects the object itself.

### Changes:

* [`f7193a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f7193abd89552b13f3030a03811bb70709771999) Return FALSE instead of NONE when picking a non existing bit from a bitset

  Just for compatibility with Red language. It is still possible to revert it using `PICK_BITSET_AS_NONE` define.
* [`c88857`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/c888570a7fafd758282ec576644a67affffe2f41) Use partial system object protection

  At this stage it is not fully protecting system object, but it is a good start to see possible issues with it.. like https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/1348
* [`127a5a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/127a5a89964c6e6518d39d15ac5867eccceff8fb) Move sys-state.h to be included by sys-core.h


## 2020 March

### Features:

* [`f913b2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f913b2739593ead409adaa9ef366f644f84d20e3) Enable `secure` again (although not fully implemented yet)
* [`414799`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4147997d8e4983a9f9d31bcde66f7c8f76efce88) FORM on a binary! creating a string without the "decoration"

  example: `"DEADBEEF" = form #{DEADBEEF}`
* [`4e4759`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4e47595ddcb69d9a9e38aaad02f7cd9af4c93aec) `deduplicate` mezzanine (modifying `unique`)

  related to: https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/1550
* [`61b39c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/61b39cafc04ffbefba496404f45d27f5597eaaec) Removing `/base` refinement from `debase` and `enbase` functions

  So eliminating ugly `??base/base` code, for example instead of:
  ```rebol
  debase/base data 16
  ```
  it is now just:
  ```rebol
  debase data 16
  ```
  
  I'm still not sure if the `base` value should not be as a first argument, but so far I will just keep it as a second one.
* [`305ed8`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/305ed83f92a59d58c495a33e6ec3832a47214318) Register %.jks file extension with DER codec
* [`628234`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/628234c64adffb91618dc78f4003d644527a3c1c) Support for Ascii85 (Base85) encoding

  `Ascii85` is a form of binary-to-text encoding used for example in PDF files.
  One can now use 85 as a `base` value in `debase` and `enbase` functions:
  
  ```rebol
  >> enbase/base "Lion" 85
  == "9PJE_"
  
  >> debase/base "9PJE_" 85
  == #{4C696F6E} ;== "Lion" if converted back to string
  ```
  
  This addition is optional, requires compilation with `INCLUDE_BASE85` define.
* [`9d5a6f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9d5a6f9f9e3d96c1d9c9aa3734dbfbabf1541cd2) Added support for case-sensitivity of `map!` keys

  With this commit maps should be compatible with Red language, where creation is case sensitive, selection is by default case insensitive unless `/case` refinement is used.
* [`dbc572`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/dbc572345865611ccf1196ccfc343c2b84fda994) WAV codec updated (vector support)

  Now loaded WAV sound data are as a vector instead of raw binary.
  WAV encoder was improved for vector data input.
  
  Example of simple sine WAV file generator:
  ```rebol
  samples: #[si16! 10000]
  repeat i 10000 [ samples/:i: 16000 * (sine i * 7.2) ]
  save %sine.wav samples ; by default mono with 44100Hz
  ```

  By default, `read` automatically tries to convert text data according give specified charset in the received header info. This may be avoided using `/binary` refinement.
* [`b755c7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/b755c7a1dc20c0449536d8b629b1249614d6db28) Allowing `@name` to be a valid email! type

  For a compatibility with Red language and also because it may be useful in dialects.
  Although `@name` is not a valid real email according RFC, one can construct invalid email values in many ways and so in real use for email apps, there should be a real additional email validation anyway.
* [`f3dfa7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f3dfa7b40b887c07d886df88d35bbd979a9c67c4) Possible auto conversion to text if found charset specification in content-type

* [`d27e4b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d27e4b13348ad1d634e003901d3f2ab51702442e) New AS native function for series coercion into a compatible datatype without copying it

  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> p: as path! b: [a b]
  == a/b
  
  >> append b 'c
  == [a b c]
  
  >> p
  == a/b/c
  ```
* [`14e4b9`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/14e4b9e7f60435c6d0364f06ea29c7e57b2a4f7c) Implemented MAP's own syntax (compatible with Red language)

  Example of a nested maps:
  ```rebol
  >> m: #(a: 1 b: #(c: 3 d: 4))
  == #(
      a: 1
      b: #(
          c: 3
          d: 4
      )
  )
  
  >> m/b/d
  == 4
  ```
* [`a84522`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a84522c267e728eae6dabd189081cfcdd9901a17) New PUT action for replacing the value following a key (in blocks and maps)
* [`9ab1b1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9ab1b134c1d9128f2b206b4dd698c5fe67bce7d0) Improving HELP output on datatypes.

  It also displays different results if used directly on datatype, like:
  ```rebol
  help char!
  ```
  
  or when used on value, which holds datatype, like in:
  ```rebol
  my-value: char!
  help my-value
  ```
  
  First one displays:
  ```
  CHAR! is a datatype.
  It is defined as a 8bit and 16bit character.
  It is of the general type scalar.
  
  Found these related words:
    null            char!      #"^@"
    space           char!      #" "
    sp              char!      #" "
    backspace       char!      #"^H"
    bs              char!      #"^H"
    tab             char!      #"^-"
    newline         char!      #"^/"

    cr              char!      #"^M"
    lf              char!      #"^/"
  ```
  
  while the second one just:
  ```
  MY-VALUE is a datatype of value: char!
  ```
* [`1162e7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1162e7d05541665433a1d02810164402900fc41a) Define a WHITESPACE charset

* [`f101d9`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f101d9fd84f1b8f0054d9a23b15198bc4af4768c) `empty?` to accept typesets

  It was already accepting bitsets, so why not to support typesets too. Added a few `typeset!` unit tests (not complete)

## 2019 November

### Features:

* [`6632c6`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6632c61a1632f44a71a953c54d431659fcf6ffa2) A little bit optimized `JOIN` mezzanine function (not using `repend` mezzanine)

## 2019 October

### Features:

* [`e74831`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/e74831216210d6e3c087c99810418b56ff5b4090) Added function for basic extra field data decoding into ZIP codec
* [`800115`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/800115a2f268c9ca4537d0ff9035aec6cc8bb83d) Updated ZIP decoder

  * Refactored decoder so it is using central directory structure
  * Added decode/info refinement used to resolve just the info about files without decompressing
  * Added access to decompress-file function which may be used to decompress single file using info from the info records
  
  Initial ZIP decoder was just traversing the file searching for the ZIP related structures. But some ZIP files (like created on macOS) does not provide valid informations in local headers and central header must be used, as it is with this update.

### Fixes:

* [`2c152b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2c152b83748f50d3fb651032ecfc3cc300569b79) System crash when reading any http request

## 2019 September

### Features:

* [`f38d49`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f38d499a6303c55111ae7b6a58bd371a93905740) Possibility to count average image color using `/color`

  For example having black&white image:
  ```rebol
  i: make image! 2x1 i/1: 0.0.0
  ```
  One can count average color using:
  ```rebol
  i/color ;== 127.127.127.255
  ```
  
  Using `/color:` will set RGB components of all pixels (ignoring alpha channel)
* [`4f1680`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4f1680959ea8b67e0a99858dedf19df46d4f8ebc) More getters/setters for image! type

  Could be optimized and enhanced later. For example it would be good to add also HSV, Hue, Saturation, Lightness etc. For these it would be good not to support only `binary!`, but also `vector!` as an input/output.
* [`d14793`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d14793dd005bdfab923c988112e2e36f8e08264a) Adding `codecs` as a shortcut for `system/codecs` and `keys-of` as an alias to `words-of`

  Because `keys-of codecs` looks better than `words-of system/codecs`
* [`6ca3c1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6ca3c178eaa7228984ef3be6f359184f56a5ddfb) Added UNIXTIME codec for conversion of Rebol datetime! to Unix epoch number and back

  Example:
  ```rebol
  encode 'unixtime 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00 ;== 1568790405
  decode 'unixtime 1568790405 ;== 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00
  ```
  string! and binary! is also supported as an input/output:
  ```rebol
  encode/as 'unixtime 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00 string! ;==  "5D81D785"
  encode/as 'unixtime 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00 binary! ;== #{5D81D785}
  decode 'unixtime  "5D81D785" ;== 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00
  decode 'unixtime #{5D81D785} ;== 18-Sep-2019/9:06:45+2:00
  ```

  The previous one was over year old, so it's time to update it into up-to-date version. Especially that now it by default does not enter console on error in evaluated script.
  (https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/61c138334d9fd93ca5760fdf685080f285251193)
  
  Note that it is not fully featured version to keep the executable small.

### Changes:

* [`19bbfe`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/19bbfee7409b826a9da3c2d0a6b983e7551f399a) XML codec by default does not trim/remove strings between tags.

  * added possibility to specify number to bytes to read directly: `binary/read #{0102} 1`
  * added possibility to write FILE! and URL! types
  * added few missing UI*BYTES variants (also with little/big endian) - but that must be revisited later!
* [`1f9199`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1f9199a9122cc59f578feb5984cfa55fed24f295) Revisited original Carl's build scripts and improving these to be able create multiple _products_ without modifying it too much.

  One could spend more time in these as they were originally written to be working also with old Rebol 2 in the bootstrap phase. There is a lot of improvement possibilities, but that is not too important for now.
  
  Main change is, that I stopped using REB_CORE define and instead use REB_VIEW when I want to build Rebol with early View functionality (not much stable/useful yet).
* [`224ea4`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/224ea4964ea35a89b987f96f91484ab804028226) Preliminary use of image native OS codecs on Windows (using Windows Imaging Component)

  If `USE_NATIVE_IMAGE_CODECS` is defined, than WIC is used instead of the original code, which supported only PNG, BMP and partially for JPEG and GIF).
  
  Using OS to do image de/encoding adds more possibilities, but so far, it still needs some work, especially for encoding, when user may want to specify various output options.

  One can now for example pretend that HTTP requests are coming from Chrome on Windows 10, when use this code before reading URL(s):
  ```rebol
  system/schemes/http/user-agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36"
  ```
  
  This may be useful, because for example Google is serving different results, when default "REBOL" user agent is used.

### Features:

* [`89bddd`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/89bdddac794160c869cb0539fdd6a0e8f45b9611) Added RL_Get_Value_Resolved as a library function which works like original RL_Get_Value, but with difference, that when resulting value is WORD, GET-WORD, PATH or GET-PATH, result is not this value, or its resolved value.

  This is useful when writing dialects as an native extension's code.
* [`bebab4`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/bebab4a8dbdde5770907b13af0a36df9bffcfcd3) When used VIEW with image as an argument, open in as a centered and resize able window;

  One can use it to start a HTTP server using just:
  ```rebol
  http-server 8080
  ```
  but most probably you would like to customize it a little bit. For details see the included %test-httpd.r3 script.
* [`cf7ba1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/cf7ba1f1d763472643e0ece019b172feff93c615) Allow DEHEX to accept `binary!` value

  ```rebol
  >> to-string dehex #{2F666F726D3F763D254335253939}
  == "/form?v=ř"
  
  >> to-string dehex to-binary "%c5%99"
  == "ř"
  
  ```

### Fixes:

## 2019 March

### Features:

* [`6b4ef6`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6b4ef6349ef39f8bf2f260eda171828138605f89) New functions TO-IDATE, TO-ITIME, enhanced TO-DATE

  For conversion to a standard Internet date/time string (as used in HTTP headers)
  Function `to-date` now can now be used to convert these strings back to date.
  It has also new refinement `/utc` for conversion to UTC date.
  
  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> to-date/utc "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 20:00:59 +0100"
  == 28-Mar-2019/19:00:59
  
  >> to-date/utc "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 20:00:59 GMT"
  == 28-Mar-2019/20:00:59
  ```
* [`8fe060`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/8fe060ac34322837f994f312f5a1e0c0460021a9) Adding /TIMEZONE to DATE values which adjust the time

  `/timezome` was first introduced in Red language and it can be used to change the time zone with adjusting the time, while `/zone` keeps time unmodified.
  
  Any date can be now easily converted to UTC just setting the `timezone` to zero.
* [`3770d7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3770d72a6557a28e3e926c09f1cee0e149507bac) Registering .epub extension into ZIP codec (so it's possible to load epub files)

  This means, that for example:
  ```rebol
  read http://www.google.jp
  ```
  will return string properly converted to Unicode (as the result from Google is served as `Shift_JIS` charset.
* [`d71a27`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d71a27195ba83b9dec226edbef3f588356d64d33) New `ICONV` native for conversion between various code pages

  This function is on Posix wrapped around [iconv](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iconv.1.html) function. On Windows it is emulated using Kernel functions for conversion between wide char and multi byte.
  
  So far there are two modes, conversion from binary to unicode string:
  ```rebol
  >> iconv #{9AE96D} 'cp1252
  == "šém"
  ```
  or from one binary to another with different encoding:
  ```rebol
  >> iconv/to #{9AE96D} 'cp1252 'utf-8
  == #{C5A1C3A96D}
  ```
* [`9347af`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9347afc64d81e61955dd3b2a4dbd521a4927a454) HTTP: Added support for transfer compression (gzip or deflate)

  Also now using system trace outputs. At this moment it's set by default to level 1 (info)
  Can be changed using for example:
  ```rebol
  system/options/log/http: 3 ;<- for max traces
  ```
* [`7b6264`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/7b6264a5ab44e7544f7984384fd40f95e369ae49) Using system/options/log to specify system log verbosity in central place

  (this is WIP as codecs and schemes are still using not centralized traces)
* [`ebaa2c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ebaa2c251eb09beda7ecfb20606508afc3cb100b) Decompress/deflate - decompression of data which are in raw deflate format (without envelope)

  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> decompress/deflate #{2B492D2E01000C7E7FD804}
  == #{74657374}
  
  ```
  
  Also using it in the ZIP codec.

* [`ef895e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ef895ef6caf433ebc509c91e8f14ea4dfaedb5ed) Bincode: added reading/writing for MSDOS date time formats (used for example in ZIP files)

  The new dialect words: MSDOS-DATE, MSDOS-TIME and MSDOS-DATETIME
* [`ae6795`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ae679561a425fa89505b30354d39e687d658c641) Added Server Name Indication extension into TLS scheme

  More details: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3
  
     TLS does not provide a mechanism for a client to tell a server the
     name of the server it is contacting.  It may be desirable for clients
     to provide this information to facilitate secure connections to
     servers that host multiple 'virtual' servers at a single underlying
     network address.
  
     In order to provide any of the server names, clients MAY include an
     extension of type "server_name" in the (extended) client hello.
* [`6194ff`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6194fffbb2f2e54bfc03e456e008feb6c21facac) Registering XML codec with POM file extension

  POM is a file used by Maven; contains build information, such as required software dependencies, dependency scope, and packaging information.
  
  Example:
  ```rebol
  load https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/google/android/gms/play-services-auth-api-phone/16.0.0/play-services-auth-api-phone-16.0.0.pom
  ```
* [`4018c5`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4018c5e37d6e191e5893ffa1da6d01ec34c24e1a) Initial implementation of OpenGL widget

  Nothing special yet, just displays hard-coded triangle with random background on redraw.
  Minimal example:
  ```rebol
  view make gob! [size: 400x400 widget: 'opengl]
  ```
* [`68d210`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/68d210adee11c738ec05d6e5f94e136ba37af8a7) Introducing _native GOB widgets_ for Windows OS.

  It's just an initial _proof of concept_. Using the existing `gob!` type as a holder of native GUI widgets. At this moment there are *partially* supported these native widgets: `button`, `check`, `radio`, `group-box`, `field`, `area`, `text`, `slider` and `date-time` (which so far works more like a date picker only).
  
  Known issues:
  
  * the native widgets are not converted to image, when using `to-image window-gob`.
  * it looks there is a memory leak in the compositor as opening/closing multiple windows has growing memory effect. This is probably not directly related to native widgets as I can see it with just an image too.
  * it's possible to append widgets into another widget's `pane`, but the position is not relative to the parent.
  * there is no helper for creating a native gobs tree (no `layout`).
  * there are still some output logs as this is really more just an experiment (and my learning playground).
  
  Simple example displaying field and a button with event handler:
  
  ```rebol
  handle-events [
  	name: 'gob-example
  	priority: 60
  	handler: func [event][
  		print ["view-event:" event/type event/offset event/gob]
  		if switch event/type [
  			close [true]
  			key   [event/key = escape]
  		] [
  			unhandle-events self
  			unview event/window
  			return none
  		]
  		switch event/type [
  			click
  			change [
  				print ["Field data:" mold fld/data]
  			]
  		]
  		none
  	]
  ]
  
  btn: make gob! [size: 200x29 offset: 20x20 widget: [button "hello"]]
  fld: make gob! [size: 200x29 offset: 20x50 widget: [field  "world"]]
  win: make gob! [size: 240x99 offset: 90x99 pane: [btn fld]]
  view/as-is win
  ```

### Features:

* [`3f182e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3f182e925c8b9bc34fb936095808e906b8afa3c3) GOB to image conversion on Windows -> `to-image make gob! []`
* [`fd4b3f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/fd4b3f6ef99724531fdf50f2c672cc02b986b0fc) Modified Saphirion/Atronix Win32 GDI compositor to be working without AGG (for color and image gob types so far)
* [`785ea9`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/785ea9f7a37e15bb08402b9e661be58aa0f3c773) FEAT: fixed crash when user dropped file into window (with `dropable` flag)

  and fixed crash when calling `show` with `none` value.
  It's now possible to receive `drop-file` event with file name in `event/data`.
  It's also possible to resolve target drop using `map-event` function.
* [`699232`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/699232609f49d08d25f0467d883870587447696e) Added basic set of SWF tag decoders into SWF file codec.
* [`af1be5`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/af1be5b3483ba309657989460e652abbf573f4bb) Enhanced BINCODE dialect with new features:

  * added /with refinement to provide additional value for reading single value like:
    `binary/read/with b 'BYTES 42` which returns just the binary and not a block with binary.
  * it's now possible to use zero bits without range error: `binary/read b [UB 0]` returns 0.
  * new read command `FIXED8` (16-bit 8.8 fixed-point number)
  * new read command `FIXED16` (32-bit 16.16 fixed-point number)
  * new read commands `TUPLE3` and `TUPLE4` (returns tuple type value from 3 or 4 bytes)
  * new read command `SkipBits` (allows to skip given number of bits without reading anything)
  * new read command `ALIGN` (aligns bit stream to byte boundary)
  * new read commands `FLOAT16`, `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` (16bit, 32bit and 64bit decimal value)
  * new read command `SI16LE` (16bit signed integer using little-endian byte order)
  * new read command `FB` (Signed, fixed-point bit value)
  * fixed read command `SB`
* [`765453`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/76545389164093fbbc6428a0c2ed5e6f3d22fd0a) Codec-swf: added a few tag readers and more verbose output (WIP)
* [`9ca5cc`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9ca5cc087cf7d1bdcd884215e5ad7c982de03b08) Bincode: added reading commands: BITSET8, BITSET16 and BITSET32
* [`ea0608`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ea06082a6118ce346c5e96f4d437e51eeb8920be) Added support for EncodedU32 in BINARY's read and write

  EncodedU32 is used in Adobe's SWF files. It defines an 32-bit unsigned integer as a sequence of 1 to 5 bytes. The most significant bit of a byte indicates if the next byte is also part of the value. The byte are ordered low to high.
* [`04cb59`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/04cb5929931cb52cb4d74e4747b87540e4e28141) Enabled "window" host extension on Windows (without graphics) so it's possible to `view gob` or `view image` to open a system window.

  Originally the windowing was dependent on `graphics` extension. Now it is independent and the graphics (using AGG ) is not yet ready.
* [`be815c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/be815c1879683085baa0dd0ffb0f60c6661c83e6) Added code for cleaning up opened MIDI connections on system QUIT (Windows only so far)
* [`764807`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/7648071ad0549d4ef5b1c790425b924bf5e6a208) Including Graham Chiu's SMTP protocol source into repository

  It is version downloaded from his repository: https://github.com/gchiu/Rebol3/blob/master/protocols/prot-smtp.r
  
  As it was not tested yet (in this branch), I'm not including it into a build. Main reason of this commit is, that I don't want to loose track of this file as it may be useful in the future (although it will need update to support TLS)
* [`1d59f8`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1d59f86e3de8181d54a4df52a94f015e2f97c781) Very minimal SWF file format codec
* [`305fc3`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/305fc368dcd02a41aa60b7041a7781a490b9b4f8) Initial MIDI port scheme implementation - macOS version

  The MIDI device is now also optional and must be enabled using `USE_MIDI_DEVICE` compilation define.
* [`3591ed`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3591edf113588247aa8a954ee792dc3c9012d8bd) Initial MIDI port scheme implementation (Windows only so far)

  Here is example how to list available input/output MIDI devices:
  ```rebol
  >> query midi://
  == make object! [
      devices-in: ["Launch Control XL"]
      devices-out: ["Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth" "Launch Control XL"]
  ]
  
  ```
  This will open MIDI port in write only mode and play a chord (Middle-C, E and G):
  ```rebol
  synth: open/write midi://1
  write synth #{903C7F00 90407F00 90437F00}
  ```
  
  The scheme is low-level so supports only binary for read/write. There can be made higher level scheme which could support a dialect for preparing the data.
  
  This is example how to get MIDI input using port's `awake`:
  ```rebol
  launch: open/read midi://device:1
  launch/awake: function [event [event!]][
  	switch event/type [
  		read  [ probe read event/port     ]
  		open  [ print "MIDI port opened!" ]
  		close [ print "MIDI port closed!" ]
  	]
  	true
  ]
  ```
  If the `awake` is defined like above and you are in some sort of `wait` loop, than whenever MIDI input is received, you would see the data from it printed in console.
  
  TODO:
      * support SYSEX messages
      * at least macOS support
* [`f6b2bb`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f6b2bb089fb5f50ef364c990bd88b49c6f25bc8b) Refine standard port specifications

  Originally there was `port-spec-head` which was holding also `path` and `host`, which are not needed in not file related schemes and does not looks good when listed.
* [`4a7852`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4a7852a68d4a9a4b8a4967e88a6745244dcb3336) Refine Find_Event function to find related event not only using event type, but also per port

  This function was introduced in Atronix branch to filter GUI events, where there was only one port. Now it's possible to use it also with schemes with multiple opened ports of the same type.
* [`9f13ef`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9f13ef94c5c0f3f4fe28455786999abb27dc11fd) CHANGE: making SET native to be more compatible with Red-language version

  There is new refinement /ONLY which treat source block or object like single value (so the result is like it was in R3-alpha)
  
  The /PAD refinement was replaced with /SOME refinement. The functionality is now reversed: when no refinement is used, it works like if there was /PAD before. If /SOME is used, there is no padding and also target value is not replaced with none value from the source, if there is any.
* [`d4261f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d4261f8b6b9c5286a06aaa5611a8b0e0147ce7dc) CHANGE: making SET native to be more compatible with Red-language version

  `The VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` mode is not handling escape codes for hiding input (`^[[8m` and `^[[28m`), which is currently used in ASK/HIDE function. As these sequences are also not fully supported on some POSIX systems, the hiding input should be solved using other way.

* [`69f4e2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/69f4e299dcd8c881d52e6728b8d0df0da33eb3ee) CHANGE: possibility to enquire the element properties of vector! values

  This commit also changes how are stored reflectors in `system/catalog`. Previously it was just block with names, now it contains also block with datatypes, which the reflector may be used with.
  
  For `vector` values, now there are probably defined all possible values to get its properties.
  Some of them:
  ```rebol
  >> v: make vector! [unsigned integer! 32 2]
  == make vector! [unsigned integer! 32 2 [0 0]]
  
  >> v/size
  == 32
  
  >> size? v
  == 32
  
  >> reflect v 'size
  == 32
  
  >> query/mode v 'size
  == 32
  
  >> v/type
  == integer!
  
  >> query v
  == make object! [
      signed: false
      type: 'integer!
      size: 32
      length: 2
  ]
  
  >> query/mode v [size: type:]
  == [
      size: 32
      type: integer!
  ]
  
  >> query/mode v [size type signed]
  == [32 integer! false]
  
  >> spec-of v
  == [unsigned integer! 32 2]
  
  ```

* [`ac8e31`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ac8e3166da09b22000df69a0e94c082f35fe0eba) CHANGE: possible to initialize VECTOR using raw binary data

  Now it is possible to do:
  ```rebol
  >> make vector! [integer! 16 #{0100 0200}]
  == make vector! [integer! 16 2 [1 2]]
  
  >> v: make vector! [decimal! 32 #{0000803F 000080BF}]
  == make vector! [decimal! 32 2 [1.0 -1.0]]
  
  ```
  Binary data must be in little-endian.
  
  This commit also enables limiting the input using the specified size.
  ```rebol
  >> make vector! [integer! 16 1 #{01000200}]
  == make vector! [integer! 16 1 [1]]
  
  >> make vector! [integer! 16 1 [1 2]]
  == make vector! [integer! 16 1 [1]]
  
  ```
  Originally the size was extended instead and so behaving like when there was no size specified.

  These natives were in Rebol2 and so why not to have them in Rebol3 again.
  Could be enhanced in future for batch conversion and or more precise version not depending on tuple value for HSV.
* [`6ea080`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6ea0800ae0e344ca536982a424b7cdaee4a38066) Improved terminal support on posix platforms

  Now unicode input is (somehow) supported and there are new key shortcuts for clearing line (CTRL-U and CTRL-K) and navigation skipping by words (OPTION key with left or right arrow)
  
  Known issues:
  When TAB is entered, the line navigation using left/right arrows and char deletion is wrong. Any idea how to fix it without disabling TAB-ed input?
  
  Note:
  Few lines of code were taken from Brian Dickens' Ren-C

## 2018 December

### Features:

* [`af0eb9`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/af0eb92688ef5a4f1186a581383dc1b4f5e5d6cc) WRITE action if used on FILE is returning the same file name instead of (closed) port!

  It enables chaining actions… for example:
  ```rebol
  >> query write %xxx "a"
  == make object! [
      name: %/X/GIT/Rebol/release-x64/xxx
      size: 1
      date: 19-Dec-2018/0:17:51.338+1:00
      type: 'file
  ]
  ```
    

  Note: `save` function is now also returning file!
* [`26b2f5`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/26b2f5671c2afefc426454ccf920144665003d67) Not throwing error when QUERY on INPUT port is run in a script not running in terminal (Travis)

  https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/2092
* [`1ebbbc`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/1ebbbc3d4607b84a004df5de330b0e5d1120c777) Enabling `T` as a delimiter between date and time and `Z` as a zero timezone, so subset of ISO8601 datetime values are loadable from Rebol.

  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> 2013-11-08T17:01
  == 8-Nov-2013/17:01
  >> 2013-11-08T17:01+0100
  == 8-Nov-2013/17:01+1:00
  >> 2013-11-08T17:01Z
  == 8-Nov-2013/17:01
  ```
* [`035df2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/035df2a2f72578c514b26ebd7843d4cc7cc51a1d) New BINCODE's read functions: SB (signed bits) and ALIGN (aligns bit stream to byte)
* [`4f6c2e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/4f6c2eb6bb056dc6286ec7e60addf5736429ccb5) Exported new library functions for better UTF8 text conversions from Rebol extension code

  New functions:
  ```C  
  RL_Get_UTF8_String
  RL_Encode_UTF8
  RL_Encode_UTF8_String
  RL_Decode_UTF_String
  ```
* [`823158`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/823158057ab8c3f786523e3c05956988771d5917) Introduced new `command` error
* [`dbd6f6`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/dbd6f6513c0da088c96a5ce6068f93607d974623) Improved support for dealing with HANDLE types in extensions

  Originally, HANDLE was just pointer, but I enhanced it recently to also being able define its type, so one can on native side test, type of provided handle and not just blindly throw some pointers as an arguments. In this commit it is reflected also when dealing with native extensions.
* [`71442f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/71442f06b678b6ee05c9f4cbfa02aae6e5692a92) Implemented block argument for QUERY/MODE for FILE, DIR, INPUT (console) and HTTP ports
* [`ebb25c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ebb25c7360caf310059d901f05b535355880ab67) Enhanced descriptions for P64 and L64 compile-flags
* [`c02753`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/c02753a66a82039dd4d36f2100c0fc15492b0f66) Implemented QUERY/MODE for FILE, DIR, INPUT (console) and HTTP ports
* [`25255d`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/25255d1fb21e021a1d92e7a3cc14eb5f53bbb442) Enable WITH function to accept also MODULE! as a context
* [`ca7bb3`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ca7bb39ebb49437683710d5469072ca17f8765ec) On Windows emulating ANSI escape codes for hiding cursor in console

  ```rebol
  print "^[[?25l" ;<-- hides cursor
  print "^[[?25h" ;<-- restores cursor visibility
  ```
  
  Here is how it is done in other languages (mostly using ANSI too):
  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Terminal_control/Hiding_the_cursor
  
  Note: this only hides the cursor.. the user input is still visible.
  To hide user input one can use:
  ```rebol
  print "^[[8m"  ;<-- hides user input
  print "^[[28m" ;<-- restores the input visibility
  ```
  Or just using: `ask/hide`
  Related commit: ad681030ac488a146cca3c57f41136f99725f27d
* [`ad6810`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ad681030ac488a146cca3c57f41136f99725f27d) Implemented ASK/HIDE (which prevents echoing user input)

  It is implemented using standard ANSI escape sequences CONCEAL/REVEAL, which are now emulated on Windows using `SetConsoleMode`.

## 2018 November

### Features:

* [`998952`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/9989527c899df8ec3415dbe61288356ce507c9dc) Pass indexes to ARRAY/initial function

  When calling ARRAY/initial with a function used to generate the values,
  pass the current index at the position the function is being called for,
  with each index in a block of sizes provided to create a multidimensional
  array being provided as a separate parameter to the function in the order
  specified in the sizes block. Uses APPLY so the function can optionally
  not take the parameters. Uses an internal function option for efficiency.
  
  See https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/2193 for details.
* [`e977b2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/e977b2e591049d61860dba08dcd9bb38423e1df7) Re-factored reb-config.h a little bit by moving __LP64__ definitions into system.r script and reverting definition of HAS_LL_CONSTS (now enabled by default and undefined where needed (old MSVC compiler only?)
* [`38f5ab`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/38f5ab3c054372d6262c49a08fee42527ffda77c) Allow one RETURN: […] specification in function's spec-block, so one could use (some) Red functions without code modifications

  So far it is ignored during function evaluation, but when used, it is visible as a new section in function's help.
* [`ed7a99`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/ed7a99d5199c9770e09ae747490ad592e9d1ee79) Indent function's help from following prompt line

* [`fba3b1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/fba3b101081642cef02a6282bf8fa031a47b9a2b) Added colored function names in the WHAT function output and added max and min function name indentation
* [`02a397`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/02a397926ee999c6c3099b554cba13682c806256) A few optimizations after quick review of the original parse-xml code
* [`6ff6d7`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/6ff6d7d9ac9588475c4cddc4b61f29723f0f45b3) Using Gavin F. MacKenzie's parse-xml+ script as a XML codec

  It's based on script downloaded from http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=xml-parse.r
  I was using this script for years in my Rebol2 environment, so I think I can include it in R3 too.. so far I never had time to review it, but I believe, it could be improved and also there are some TODO notes inside the original script.
* [`a9597c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a9597ce41bef60ce64ffeaad12a78e0dfb02c919) Added infix shift operators: <<  and >>

* [`902973`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/90297372773e7bfca128bd8f2ebc26c668e3ff6b) Trying to fix some of lzma related issues reported by Travis

## 2018 October

### Features:

* [`e46eff`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/e46effee5ec8e029918890f84f39a4d6e9763712) Initial support for (optional) LZMA compression in COMPRESS and DECOMPRESS functions

  So far it is implemented like the original COMPRESS, which is appending size of uncompressed data at tail of compressed data.
  
  To include the LZMA, there must be used USE_LZMA compiler's definition while compiling Rebol.
  
  LZMA source is from LZMA SDK version 18.05 from https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html slightly modified for use with Rebol source.
* [`5ec778`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/5ec778ee15c88053a0d6425951099e4a5f4c3f39) Experimentally trying to protect system/standard object from modification
* [`30e89a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/30e89acd0bb4c102be0883c813196a4e8e71d779) Rewritten TLS protocol to support TLSv1.2 (may be still unstable)

  It's possible to turn on various traces using:
  
  ```rebol
  system/schemes/tls/set-verbose 3
  ```
* [`25bbca`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/25bbca8b7552bbf286a08695d414eae4062747cb) Initial version of CRT codec

  Converts certificate raw data into readable tree structure. It is most probably not complete. But is usable in basic form for retrieving RSA key from a certificate.
* [`26dd2c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/26dd2cda62be98e5f422f1736971fc485e358c29) Allowing ANY-STRING! for start-* functions in quick-test-module

  (so one can use for example URL as a test title)
* [`2b9b90`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2b9b90dd27bf80bb0d7ba2ec4495242668390b6f) Revisited REB_HANDLE implementation and usage

  Initially the HANDLE value was just holding a pointer to function. But I think it is also useful to have HANDLE hold a series value, which can hold any internal data. In most cases GC can free this series once handle is not referenced. There will be also needed some sort of callback to dispose function for some more specific HANDLEs in future. That is not yet implemented.
  
  I also reviewed a little bit the CRYPT natives as HANDLEs are used in these functions to hold context. What I can say so far, HANDLE was also used as a CODEC entry (where I added test for the proper handle type) and extension dispatcher.
* [`3d347f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3d347f1ee85053fec04f27d0417443a2ab7e91f7) Initial version of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder (codec)

* [`69015f`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/69015fea0a45389298795fe22a03d5c780939ce7) Forcing recycle at end of tests and showing memory stats
* [`3e9a71`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/3e9a71d4ec8d631d34a9b942101bbd9b375b3b98) Added counter of asserts in current test (so failed asserts are easier to find)
* [`cec598`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/cec598ba44dfd6fd78b38dea80b207c66d65b7a3) Initial version of BinCode => Binary DSL
* [`850d69`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/850d697be3db394198a5f11c0cf6f4544fb95170) Improved FORMAT dialect so one can specify escape color codes (using money! value)

  Simple usage example:
  
  ```rebol
  print format [$31.47 "some text" $0] ""
  ```
  
  would print red text on gray background (depending on color palette of the terminal)
  
  The string returned by format function would look like: `"^[[32;47msome text^[[0m"`
* [`23f22a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/23f22a2c08a4ead607fa60f0928359e5adaf91bc) Added a few test vectors for AES128 and AES256 cipher suite
* [`902547`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/902547531daef1ff50c0b7ec7d15753e71c8bb25) Added recommendation note not to use RC4 as it is prohibited by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7465
* [`cf740c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/cf740c4cd0670271ca7265e4c418890421059e1f) Making UNSET! as a conditionally "TRUTHY"

  It reverts changes discussed in above issues as I consider this behavior to be more useful and it is compatible with Rebol2 and Red.
  
  My main reason is to be able use PRINT inside ALL blocks without need to worry if these would affect the evaluation.
  
  Like in this case:
  ```rebol
  	if all [
  		not headers
  		any [
  			all [
  				d1: find conn/data crlfbin
  				d2: find/tail d1 crlf2bin
  				print "server using standard content separator of #{0D0A0D0A}"
  			]
  			all [
  				d1: find conn/data #{0A}
  				d2: find/tail d1 #{0A0A}
  				print "server using malformed line separator of #{0A0A}"
  			]
  		]
  	][ … ]
  
  ```

  (evaluates a given block binded to specified context)
* [`7c2341`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/7c23410230829b61b9b01c16b67dfd99c615a704) Small change in output of ?? debug function

  (so it is easier to copy the output for immediate use in console again)

### Fixes:

## 2018 September

### Features:

* [`fb113c`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/fb113c63760ce9a9606e45988d574f5265e65d68) Added support for SHA384 and SHA512 checksums

  Possible usage:
  ```rebol
  data: #{0bad}
  port: open checksum://
  sum1: read write port bin
  sum2: read write/part open port tail bin -2 ;port was restarted using OPEN
  sum3: read write/seek/part open port bin 2 -2
  all [sum1 = sum2 sum1 = sum3] ;== true
  ```
* [`78cc32`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/78cc325c8309eefe4262284d449cece3b4980968) CHECKSUM implemented also as a scheme (so one can do incremental computation)

  Basic usage:
  ```rebol
  port: open checksum://sha256
  write port #{0bad}

* [`55031b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/55031b7ec6dbefdd3da57487cb44ea886a4eab17) Initial RSA crypt integration

  The main RSA/Bigint code (Copyright (c) 2007, Cameron Rich) is taken from the latest Atronix version, but the Rebol native part was rewritten as a native while original Cyphre's version was as an extension. I also quite didn't like his RSA key as a simple Rebol object, modified the command names and removing padding setting (which was just confusing for me and source of possible problems)
  
  In this commit is also included a test file (tests/units/rsa-test.r3) as it really deserve some testing and it may be used as a hint how to use it.
  
  Know issues:
  
  - there is no way to release or re-use the RSA key handles.
  - when running from Visual Studio, the random number generator calls some assertion in cryptsp.dll, so it would be good to fix it or use own random generator.
  
  TODO:
  
  - possibility to import the key from some standard text files
  - it would be nice to have in-build RSA key generator
* [`b54e1b`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/b54e1b865c9311871f10537667c6206f09a766fa) Improving DEBASE so it can decode URL safe Base64 variant input even without using a /url refinement

  Previously this would throw an error:
  
  ```rebol
  >> debase "qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA=="
  ** Script error: data not in correct format: "qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA=="
  ```
  
  The reason is that the input is using URL safe alphabet. With this commit when such a situation is detected, the decoder restarts itself automatically as if it would be used with /url refinement.
  
  NOTE: if you are sure that input should be in URL safe format, use the refinement to avoid unnecessary computations.
  
  Possible test:
  ```rebol
  key: "qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA=="
  equal? (debase key) (debase/url key) ;== should be TRUE
  ```

  improves: https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues/issues/2318

  ```rebol
  key1: "qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA=="
  probe bin: debase/url key1
  probe key1 = enbase/url bin ;== should be true
  
  ;debase is working also when input is missing the padding
  key2: "qL8R4QIcQ_ZsRqOAbeRfcZhilN_MksRtDaErMA"
  probe bin = debase/url key2 ;== should be true

## 2018 July

### Features:

* [`64fbcc`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/64fbcc695a8ac8ff969fd259232653ab527de57c) Just a very basic WAV codec (decoder)

  To be honest, I'm not sure how useful it is as one gets just binary,
  but no aditional info. It should return a sound object instead!
  So far it can be considered just as a minimal codec example.

### Fixes:

* [`fc5b8a`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/fc5b8a46f12d3bbd30239c13a02875efa3f789b9) DELECT Bypasses PROTECT
* [`942470`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/942470a847915c63a67834402b0fe9d15a3a4d0d) Better handling ANSI escape sequences (on Windows)

## 2018 June

### Features:

* [`2231a1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/2231a1db082cbb80649c53bb20c3f2476e4d949f) Add PAIR! support for REPEAT

  This change allows PAIR! values as value argument of REPEAT. This
  enables convenient traversal over a 2D space:
  ```rebol
  >> repeat p 3x3 [print p]
  1x1
  2x1
  3x1
  1x2
  2x2
  3x2
  1x3
  2x3
  3x3
  ```
  Similar to REPEAT over decimals, REPEAT over pairs implies a start of
  1.0x1.0 and a default bump of 1.0 for each component. The first pair
  component ("X") is varied first, which is in line with pair!-based
  indexing into image!s.
  
  For the sake of completeness, PAIR! support is also enabled in the
  legacy C-style FOR:
  ```rebol
  >> for p 10x10 15x20 5x5 [print p]
  10x10
  15x10
  10x15
  15x15
  10x20
  15x20
  
  >> for p 3x1 1x2 -1x1 [print p]
  3x1
  2x1
  1x1
  3x2
  2x2
  1x2
  ```

* [`a35168`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a35168b18b5b4430eced8e60294dbf471ea8041d) New native: NAN?

  Returns TRUE if the number is Not-a-Number.
  Example:
  ```rebol
  >> nan? 1
  == false
  
  >> nan? 1.#NaN
  == true
  
  >> nan? 1.0 / 0
  == false
  
  >> nan? sin 2.0
  == false
  
  >> nan? asin 2.0
  == true
  
  ```
* [`a13b33`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a13b3367fbd6f450e192907f530a2e94743e6de5) Updating Windows' prebuild R3 executable
* [`cd09db`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/cd09db2bfc270bd74e2b9750c4c470fba4bdde8b) New natives ARCTANGENT2 and ATAN2

  ATAN2 is direct mapping to libc's ATAN2 function without any conversion so does not accept integer types as an input.
  
  ARCTANGENT2 is more user friendly (but little bit slower) - it uses pair! type as an input of the coordinates and result is in degrees by default (may be changed using /radians refinement)
  
  Example output:
  ```rebol
  >> arctangent2 10x-10
  == -45.0
  
  >> arctangent2/radians 10x-10
  == -0.7853981633974483
  
  >> atan2 -10.0 10.0
  == -0.7853981633974483
  
  ```
  
  NOTE: notice that ATAN2 is using the input in classic order (Y and X)
* [`72d815`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/72d81552cc965a8d6fd00f2b4e088f5cb6a2184c) Faster trigonometric functions (without conversions and bounds checks)

  While the original functions SINE, COSINE, TANGENT and ARCTANGENT works also with degrees and do better output formating, these new functions: SIN, COS, TAN and ATAN expects only value in radians and are directly mapped to libc trigonometric functions. They will be faster, but one must expect different output in some cases!
  
  Difference example:
  ```rebol
  >> tangent/radians (pi / 2)
  == 1.#INF
  
  >> tan (pi / 2)
  == 1.633123935319537e16
  ```
  NOTE: these functions are available only with INFINITY support (needs 1.#NaN value)
* [`669f86`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/669f86dd66b629347d330158775006afb53c15a3) Modified the structure of the Rebol native code specification in C files

  Now it looks more like the default Rebol source code header banner.
  This is full example of the native function including it's Rebol specification:
  
  ```C
  /***********************************************************************
  **
  */	REBNATIVE(sin)
  /*
  //	sin: native [
  //		{Returns the trigonometric sine.}
  //		value [decimal!] "In radians"
  //	]
  ***********************************************************************/
  {
  	SET_DECIMAL(D_RET, sin(VAL_DECIMAL(D_ARG(1))));
  	return R_RET;
  }
  ```
  
  NOTE: these definitions are parsed in tools/make-headers.r script
  At this moment the parser don't work with C preprocessing - so it would collect also code from `#ifndef` blocks -  this must be improved!
* [`d7fd2e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d7fd2ec11af0f250dbb9e19335cc5a952524f405) Added support for loading NaN (1.#NaN) and Infinite (1.#INF) values and using them in decimal computations

  This feature is optional and can be turned of by using USE_NO_INFINITY compilation define.
* [`d5a978`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/d5a978bf725f3ef650accbdd63e595b7cb5b46d5) Define ~ as a shortcut for system/options/home

  So it is like in *nix shells and one can use it like:
  ```rebol
  >> cd ~
  == %/X/Rebol/
  
  >> cd ~/..
  == %/X/
  
  ```
* [`5fa2db`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/5fa2db14bd77b1b71a626d2ab5cbc9b137c767e7) Added manifest file into Windows resources

  and renamed ico file
* [`c011a2`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/c011a259e2bf626a96c4111566596aa07d10d9a1) Unifying return and error handling from the original `access-os` function

  Instead of `0` it returns `true` as a result of successful `set` operation
  Instead of returning none, it throws `not supported on your system` error when return value is of type OS_ENA
  It throws error when any other error happen.
  
  So for example on Windows it looks like:
  
  ```rebol
  >> access-os/set 'pid 33488 ;<-- terminates process
  == true
  
  >> access-os/set 'pid 33488
  ** Access error: process not found: 33488
  ** Where: access-os
  ** Near: access-os/set 'pid 33488
  
  >> access-os 'euid
  ** Internal error: euid not supported on your system
  ** Where: access-os
  ** Near: access-os 'euid
  
  ```
* [`64b724`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/64b724c3b5d493f4667ebdf17e4b6761c74b5f6d) Making at least basic SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals be mapped to Os_Kill on Windows to be compatible with posix version…

  So `access-os/set 'pid [32464 15]` will terminate process on all systems.
* [`f7ed5e`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/f7ed5ef37fd608150a3c1528b44b142e0afc8d3f) Add a native 'access-os'

  Based on commit: https://github.com/zsx/r3/commit/275c8672810f2beb760ecfeebcf82769da76b78e
  But slightly modified - the OS_E* definitions were moved to reb-defs.h file
  
  Original commit message:
  
  > It's almost like what's in R2, with the addition of 'euid and 'egid, and
  > additional signal number to kill the process:
  >
  > access-os/set 'pid [2123 9] ;send a signal 9 (SIGKILL) to process 2123
* [`5c5241`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/5c5241c96b49a6c37023491c8e26db337bf3dd30) Added block with define flags into make-settings so one could use these in the compilation using generated makefile
* [`aa10d1`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/aa10d1221ed6e3ac075be453d3f9e23bc31cd89b) Image codecs are now included only when requested using compilation defines

  To enable these codecs one must use these defines:
  ```C
  USE_PNG_CODEC
  USE_BMP_CODEC
  USE_JPG_CODEC
  USE_GIF_CODEC
  ```
* [`a7b056`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/a7b05627a3d31621732add94e8f76f9307e8bffb) Automatically collecting base code from C sources

  If such a comment is used in C file:

  		system/codecs/wav/type: 'binary!
  		append append system/options/file-types system/codecs/wav/suffixes 'wav
  	]
  
  ***********************************************************************/
  ```
  The Rebol code from it is extracted and included just after content of the src/mezz/base-defs.r
  
  Note that at this stage there is just a minimal system available, so one must be careful, what code is used.
* [`582e43`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/582e43d309b30602e579917b0bd148945bb5911a) Picking the right PICK

  In Rebol2, picking value with index 0 was always returning null. In R3-alpha it was changed that zero index was working like index -1… more at this blog http://www.rebol.net/cgi-bin/r3blog.r?view=0173
  
  I decided to revert this change and let it working as before (and so be compatible with Red too)
  
  So now it works for example like:
  ```rebol
  >> pick tail "123" -1
  == #"3"
  >> pick tail "123" 0
  == none
  ```
  and it is also consistent with AT positioning:
  ```rebol
  >> at tail "123" -1
  == "3"
  ```
* [`690dff`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/690dffaa0474075f4b327e2a93a80c2b3bb24858) REDUCE/NO-SET working also with set-path!

  ```rebol

* [`e489fe`](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/e489fef30413df9a9c9e3383da917ced30990697) Native's specification may be defined directly in C code using special header structure

  This is based on Hostile Fork's work on Ren-c, just without using his INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_* macros.
  It is still possible to use the old way definitions, so the original code does not have to be completely modified.
  
  For example:
  ```C
  /**********************************************************************/
  //
  //  test-native: native [
  //	  {This is just a native function for test purpose.}
  //	  'value [any-type!] "This can be value of any type"
  //  ]
  //
  REBNATIVE(test_native)
  {
  	REBVAL *val = D_ARG(1);
  	printf("Value has type ID: %i\n", VAL_TYPE(val));
  	return R_ARG1; //return the same value
  }
  ```
