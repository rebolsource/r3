		0.0.1 original tested in 2010
		0.0.2 updated for the open source versions
		0.0.3 Changed to use a synchronous mode rather than async.  Authentication not yet supported
		0.0.4 Added LOGIN, PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication.  Tested against CommunigatePro
		0.0.5 Changed to move credentials to the url or port specification
		0.0.6 Fixed some bugs in transferring email greater than the buffer size.

		Where message is an email with all the appropriate headers.
		In Rebol2, this was constructed by the 'send function
		
		If you need to use smtp asynchronously, you supply your own awake handler
